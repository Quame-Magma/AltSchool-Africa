        <h1>BIOGRAPHY, REASONS & GOALS FOR JOINING ALTSCHOOL AFRICA</h1>
        <p>
            Well before I move into all that biography and reasons why I joined, let me tell you a little bit about my professional life. I am a dedicated and results-driven IT Support Specialist with 
            over two years of experience in providing technical solutions and exceptional client service. Proficient in troubleshooting complex hardware, software, and network issues while maintaining 
            high standards of customer satisfaction. Skilled in designing scalable and secure IT infrastructures, responsive web development, and cloud-based solutions using AWS. Organized, 
            detail-oriented, and adept at managing multiple priorities with a positive attitude. Holds certifications in AWS Solutions Architecture and Google IT Support, complemented by a BSc in 
            Information Technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've had this long time dream and passion of becoming a software engineer since my senior high school days. But I guess there are forces that takes away such motivations when we set our minds 
            to do something we love and want to actually devote our time to. This was my kind of situation I was facing even during my university days. I lacked the motivation and zeal to see it through 
            but I guess all that will change now. The reason why I actually joined AltSchool is to further fulfil that lifelong dream of creating life-changing solutions that'll make people's lives easier. 
            I want to make sure I keep the promise I made to myself some years back, where in some years to come, I'll look back and be like "YES I MADE IT". 
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, about my goals for AltSchool's school of Engineering, I strive to be if not the best but one of the best software engineers in my country, my continent, and the entire globe by mastering 
            the necessary technologies and techniques in the field, while creating scalable and life-changing solutions that'll ease the difficulty people face in certain areas of their lives.
